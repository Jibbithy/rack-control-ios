///      the app is entitled to, including its own implicit bundle group. So
///      `load` finds a token written by the old, un-shared build without
///      knowing anything about where it was written.
///
/// Together those mean nothing here has to discover the team prefix at
/// runtime: `migrateToSharedGroup` reads each copy's group off the copy itself.
